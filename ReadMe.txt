Version Update:
Purpose: Implemented Code Review Comments and fixed the bug

The start up project is "Set5Problem1ConsoleApp"

The console app asks the question
"Do you want to enter a secret message?(Y/N)"

If the user provides response ('Y' or 'y'), the application accepts the input in standard format(COUNTRY_NAME, "SECRET_MESSAGE")

When the user provides the input 'n' or 'N', the application evaluates the secret messages and provides answer on whether King Shan is the ruler.
