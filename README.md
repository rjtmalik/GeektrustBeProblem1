# Golden Crown

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to allow the kingdoms of Southeros to conquer another kingdom so that she becomes the ruler of Southeros

## Problem Statement
A kingdom can become the ruler only when she has 3 or more allies. The kingdom can secure allies by sending secret messages to another kingdom. If the receiver accepts the message, then she concedes to the invading kingdom.

## Tests
The unit tests are stored in the solution Problem5Process.Tests

## Dependencies
None

## How to Run

The start up project is "Set5Problem1ConsoleApp"

The console app asks the question
"Do you want to enter a secret message?(Y/N)"

If the user provides response ('Y' or 'y'), the application accepts the input in standard format(COUNTRY_NAME, "SECRET_MESSAGE")

When the user provides the input 'n' or 'N', the application evaluates the secret messages and provides answer on whether King Shan is the ruler.
